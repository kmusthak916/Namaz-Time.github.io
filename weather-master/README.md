# amCharts Weather Map

Version: 1.0.5


## Description

amCharts Weather Map is a JavaScript library that helps your create beautiful, dynamically-updated, searchable maps and charts with all kinds of weather-related information


## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have your own [OpenWeather API-Key](http://openweathermap.org/price) to be able to retrieve the weather data.

##### Quick and Dirty
You just want to give it a quick try and check it's capabilities, follow these few points.
* Uncompressed (development version)
	* Copy [`/`](./blob/master/) anywhere you want or leave it there.
	* Delete [`/build`](./blob/master/build/) in your _anywhere_ (actually not necessary)
	* Place your OpenWeather API-Key in [`/assets/js/OPENWEATHER_APIKEY.js`](./blob/master/build/assets/js/OPENWEATHER_APIKEY.js).
	* Open [`/index.html`](./blob/master/index.html) and voilá.

* Compressed (production version)
	* Copy [`/build`](./blob/master/build/) anywhere you want or leave it there.
	* Place your OpenWeather API-Key in [`/build/assets/js/OPENWEATHER_APIKEY.js`](./blob/master/build/assets/js/OPENWEATHER_APIKEY.js).
	* Open [`/build/index.html`](./blob/master/build/index.html) and voilá.

##### Using under SSL
If you are going to run this tool under SSL-encoded URL, you'll need to update
the OpenWeather API endpoint in your `OPENWEATHER_APIKEY.js`. The default one
is as follows:

```
OPENWEATHER_ENDPOINT = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/";
```

To use the SSL-enabled endpoint, update it to:

```
OPENWEATHER_ENDPOINT = "https://pro.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/";
```

Please note, that SSL connection is not available with their free and Starup 
subscription plans. You'll need at least Developer subscription.

##### Advanced
You did it quick and dirty and now you feel to mess around with it? Here we go, this is your new route.
* Enter your new playground in [`/assets`](./blob/master/assets) and get crazy (not the one in [`/build`](./blob/master/build/)).
* Place your OpenWeather API-Key in [`/assets/js/OPENWEATHER_APIKEY.js`](./blob/master/assets/js/OPENWEATHER_APIKEY.js).
* If needed adapt the [`index.html`](./blob/master/index.html) as well.
* Open the [`index.html`](./blob/master/index.html) in your browser to enjoy all your changes.
* Everything good? Alright you probably wonder [`how to build`](#how-to-build).


## How to build

We use [`gruntjs`](http://gruntjs.com/) to do all the magic behind the scenes.
It minifies and combines several files together to lower the payload of the web-app.

* Install [NPM and node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
* Install [Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower)
* Goto `/` of this web-app in  your terminal
* Run following command to install all node dependencies
```
> npm install -D
```
* Run following command to install all bower dependencies
```
> bower install
```
* Run grunt to create your own build
```
> grunt
```
* Copy [`/build`](./blob/master/build/), place it anywhere you want and voilá.

Important thing to know is this: amCharts Weather Map is not a product. It's 
rather a showcase of what can be done with amCharts products. While we'll do 
our best to answer your queries in GitHub issue tracker, we won't be able to
extend full-fledged [amCharts support service](https://www.amcharts.com/support/about-support/)
to this tool.
